# See ClassicPluginStrategy.DETACHED_LIST. As of JENKINS-47634 also used by plugin-compat-tester.

# Columns are: plugin ID, last core release still containing the plugin's functionality, plugin version that's implied, minimum Java specification version where to install the plugin

# Note that all split plugins between and including matrix-auth and jaxb incorrectly use the first
# core release without the plugin's functionality when they should use the immediately prior release.
# Fixing these retroactively won't help, as the difference only matters to those specific versions.

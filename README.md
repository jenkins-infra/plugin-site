This is the frontend application driven by data from the Jenkins Update Center.

## Architecture

The application is developed using [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), and [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/).

Production deployments are static html and css files, while development is run through the gatsby development server.

We welcome any enhancements and bugfixes, please see our [guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) on how you can
